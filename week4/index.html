                        <p>Javascript can recieve infromation from a form using DOM</p>
                        <p>Information that is recieved from a form using javascript can be translated into json format
                            for future
                            use through searching. </p>
                        <p>Javascript can be used for error checking and data validity in forms.
                            Check to see if a invalid character is being submitted.</p>
                        <p>Using event listeners and functions you can disable sumbit buttons until the requirements are
                            met.</p>

                    <h1 class="blueBanner">Object-oriented programming</h1>
                    <div class="notes">
                    <p>Have one specific function that creates an object. Then call it using new to make a new instance
                        of that
                        object with a specific new name and parameters if desired.</p>
                    <p>Static variables or methods can be called directly from a object or instance. class example
                        {static
                        test() { return 'Passed the test'}} then the specific static test can be called directly with
                        example.test().</p>

                    <p>Prototyping can be used to add a new property or data to method. However it should only be used
                        for
                        propeties of a method which will be the same across all instances of the given method.</p>
                    <p>Constructors are the default information that is used when a method is called and instantiated
                        without
                        specific parameters or instructions to do otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Getters and setters are used to control the flow of data in and out of a object/method.</p>
                    <p>Objects can create other objects such as a panda #2 throws a ninja star 5 times. Each ninja star
                        is its
                        own object and is called each time the panda throws one.</p>

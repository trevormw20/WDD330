        <h2>Week 4</h3>
            <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <h4>Forms</h4>
            <p>Javascript can recieve infromation from a form using DOM</p>
            <p>Information that is recieved from a form using javascript can be translated into json format for future
                use through searching. </p>
            <p>Javascript can be used for error checking and data validity in forms.
                Check to see if a invalid character is being submitted.</p>
            <p>Using event listeners and functions you can disable sumbit buttons until the requirements are met.</p>
            <p></p>


            <h4>Object-oriented programming</h4>
            <p>Have one specific function that creates an object. Then call it using new to make a new instance of that
                object with a specific new name and parameters if desired.</p>
            <p>Static variables or methods can be called directly from a object or instance. class example {static
                test() { return 'Passed the test'}} then the specific static test can be called directly with
                example.test().</p>

            <p>Prototyping can be used to add a new property or data to method. However it should only be used for
                propeties of a method which will be the same across all instances of the given method.</p>
            <p>Constructors are the default information that is used when a method is called and instantiated without
                specific parameters or instructions to do otherwise.</p>
            <p>Getters and setters are used to control the flow of data in and out of a object/method.</p>
            <p>Objects can create other objects such as a panda #2 throws a ninja star 5 times. Each ninja star is its
                own object and is called each time the panda throws one.</p>

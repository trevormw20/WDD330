                    <h1 class="blueBanner">Debugging</h1>
                    <div class="notes">
                        <ul>
                            <li>alert(variable) is one of my favorite to use because it pauses the code till you hit okay. This helps me out alot when finding where is the error.</li><br>
                            <li>console.log(variable) is great as well to see mutliptle results at the end of the code, not just stop at one error.</li><br>
                            <li>console.trace() can be used to find which specific function the log came from.</li><br>
                            <li>debugger can show you in browser what is happening in your code at the point in which the debugger line is located in the code. (must be removed from final product)</li><br>
                            <li>error() can show the user an error message or information. This can be used for invalid forms or informing the user that their action is not valid.</li><br>
                            <li>throw can be used to halt the code from continuing and send a message or variable.</li>
    
                        </ul> 
                    </div>

                    <h1 class="yellowBanner">Testing</h1>
                    <div class="notes">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Try, catch, finaly these are used to test if something is able to be run before the code breaks and catches the error before it continues. Finally with run after a catch if more code is wanted.</li><br>
                            <li>jest -c {} can see if everything is running smoothly and see if their is a hold in your code by telling you how long it took.</li><br>
                            <li>To install jest (npm install -g jest) test to see if working and version (jest -v)</li>
                        
                        </ul>

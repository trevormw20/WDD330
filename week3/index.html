            <p>OBJECTS</p>

            <p>Objects are like multi-dimensional arrays but with specific names given to each location in the array.
            </p>

            <p>Var classes = {elective: “Woodshop”, science: “Chemistry”, math: “algebra 2”};
            </p>

            <p>These can be accessed with classes.science or classes[“science”];
            </p>

            <p>Objects allow things to be sorted easier and easy to read and locate for future use.
            </p><br>

            <p>DOM</p>

            <p>DOM allows you to access any html element on a page. This enables you to edit, remove or add a new
                element to any part of your page.
            </p>

            <p>document.getElementById(exampleId);
            </p>

            <p>If an element does not have a specific class or id you can always access the parent element and then use
                innerHTML to access the lower element.
            </p>

            <p>DOM is not only good for changing but also for selecting all elements. This can be used as a filter or
                search function. By selecting all elements that are associated with the filter request and only showing
                those specific parts of the website that are associated with the element.
            </p><br>

            <p>EVENTS
            </p>

            <p>Can replace buttons with onclick to trigger a javascript function or do some javascript right in the html
                file.
            </p>

            <p>Pictures and slides can be changed with onmouseover and onmouseout.
            </p>

            <p>Common events include
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Onchange</li>
                <li>Onclick</li>
                <li>Onload</li>
                <li>Onmouseout</li>
                <li>onmouseover </li>
                <li>Onkeydown</li>
            </ul>


            <p>There are events for almost any situation on a website.
            </p>

            <p>Events can help create interaction and verify user input before submission.
            </p>

            <p>Events listen for a change then the DOM can change the specific element to react to the event that just
                occurred.
